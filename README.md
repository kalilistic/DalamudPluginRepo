# Kal's Dalamud Plugin Repository
My third party plugin repository used for testing new releases before I publish them to the official repository. These should be considered experimental and subject to bugs unless otherwise noted.

## How to use
1. Open the plugin installer by typing `/xlplugins` in the chat window and pressing enter.
2. Click the "Settings" button at the bottom left.
3. Copy and Paste in the following URL into one of the blank inputs under the "Custom Plugin Repositories" section: `https://github.com/kalilistic/DalamudPluginRepo/raw/master/pluginmaster.json`
4. Click the "+" button to add it to the list.
5. Ensure the "Enabled" checkbox is checked.
6. Click "Save and Close" at the bottom.
7. Close the Plugin Installer window by clicking the "X" in the top right corner.
8. Open the Plugin Installer window again by typing `/xlplugins` in the chat window and pressing enter.

The plugins will now show up under "Available Plugins" like any others.
